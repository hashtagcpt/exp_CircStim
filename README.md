Psychopy experiment - gabors with variable contrast (*GabCon*).  
Works with psychopy `1.83.04` - newer pasychopy versions may not work because the experiment uses an ugly hack 
on pyglet to be able to display stimuli with contrast `> 1.` without psychopy marking regions `> 1.` with noise (but trimming to 1.).
